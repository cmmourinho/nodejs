This is a basic HTTP server built using Node.js's built-in `http` module. The server listens for incoming requests and responds with a "Hello, World!" message.

## Features

- Listens on `127.0.0.1` (localhost) and port `3000`

## Requirements

## Setup

1. **Clone or download the repository**:
   If you haven't already, clone or download the repository containing the `server.js` file.

2. **Install dependencies**:
   There are no external dependencies for this server since it uses Node.js's built-in `http` module.
